#ABSTRACT
In this project we are created one application which is easy to access user friendly. For this application we used the backend as Mysql  DB to store the data which is used in the application and for the user interface we had used the Jsp and HTML. Two kinds of people are able to use this application as warden and the student as well. The warden is able to  add  student very easily, add leave, late details and by seeing the payment log .The warden is the only person who is able to add and remove the student from the hostel and take attendance daily.

#Objectives
The main objectives of this project work are that:
    • Student will no longer apply for their hostels manually.
    • The warden can see and access the student’s data.
    • This also will reduce the manual work of the persons in admin penal.
    • It helps the admin to know the number of students that can leave in a room and a block.
    • To ensure that the number of student staying in a room does not exceed specified limit.
    • Help the admin to disseminate information to students without calling for a meeting.
    • To know the number of items (e.g. bed) given to student staying in the hostel

The system helps the admin to:
    • Allot different students to their different rooms.
    • Vacate the student from the hostels
    • Control the status of the hostel fee payment.
    • Edit the details of the students and modify the students records.
    • Generating payment report.

#SCOPE OF PROJECT
The scope of the project is clear to give a simple and attractive application to simplify the work as well as to reduce the efforts while doing it offline or we can say by doing it with old methods.
In this application we are able to save database of all students present in the hostel and we can add, remove students , add leave, late details of the students, marking attendance everyday , generating report the payment log details. Also If any student is absent without taking leave then mail will be sent to their respective gaurdian, student records can be added by uploading csv file successfully.
